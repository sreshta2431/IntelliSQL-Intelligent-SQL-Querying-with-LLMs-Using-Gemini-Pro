# IntelliSQL-Intelligent-SQL-Querying-with-LLMs-Using-Gemini-Pro

IntelliSQL is an AI-powered application that enables users to generate SQL queries using natural language. Instead of manually writing complex SQL statements, users can describe what they need in plain English, and the system converts their request into accurate, executable SQL queries using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Google Gemini Pro.

The system works by accepting natural-language input (e.g., “Show me the top-selling products last month”), interpreting the intent using an LLM, and translating that intent into a valid SQL query. The generated query is then executed against a connected database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite), and the results are displayed in a structured, readable format.

IntelliSQL reduces the need for SQL expertise, making data exploration accessible to non-technical users. It accelerates analytics workflows, supports complex joins and aggregations, and enables conversational data interaction. The project can be integrated into dashboards, reporting systems, and business intelligence tools for smarter data-driven decision-making.
